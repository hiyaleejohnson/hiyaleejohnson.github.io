Its been a while now, writing and releasing CTFs.  
What have I learned?

**Keep Skills Sharp**  
I've worked previously in Operations and as Developer, and I run a bunch of sites so it would be easy to fall into complacency. Setting up the infrastructure and building the stack for a CTF is a fantastic refresher to keep skills sharp.   
Know Apache inside out? Throw yourself at Nginx.  
Need to build something? Try a different framework than last time.  

**Hints**  
People will need help.  
It would be helpful to have meaningful hints ready to drop prepped in advance.  

**Engagement**  
As a techy, by law my soft skills are shot to hell.  
This is something I am working on but I can see that player interaction is needed to deliver hints and chat.  
I'm really hoping that [#ctfwhysomanybiscuits](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ctfwhysomanybiscuits) will take off in all honesty.  
Meanwhile please feel free to direct message me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lj_actual) with questions or comments.

**Logs**  
The logs of a CTF will show "B4ckdoor-owned-you" more times than you can shake a tool at.  
They also show that the bots are out there waiting for you.
