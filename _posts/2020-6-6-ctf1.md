I have initially started this blog as a place to share some CTF challenges I've written.

Here is the 1st one I'm sharing, from last year -  [megabiscuits](https://hiyaleejohnson.github.io/ctf/megabiscuits.html).

**The Challenge**  
What is the breed of fish?  
What is the name of the fish?

I hope you enjoy playing.  
When you get the answer(s) give me a direct message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lj_actual).
