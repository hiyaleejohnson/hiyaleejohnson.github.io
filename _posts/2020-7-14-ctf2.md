Last time I shared a [CTF that was horriffic](https://hiyaleejohnson.github.io/ctf1).  
It was designed to mangle the brain, and all feedback suggests that is exactly what happened.  
Someday soon I'll publish the solution for those players that still drop in on it.

Here today I'm sharing, a much easier challenge - [**DOM**](https://hiyaleejohnson.github.io/ctf/dom.html).  
I've seen this one done quickly so don't fear! 

**The Challenge**  
How far is it in miles (via M6) from Rhyl to the given destination?  

I hope you enjoy playing.  
When you get the answer give me a direct message on [twitter](https://twitter.com/lj_actual).
